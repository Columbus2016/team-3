Repository for Susan G Komen's social breast cancer survivor support application. 
Made at Code for Good 2016 

Currently there separate apps for user profile(Rails app) and the User Connectivity(NodeJS, Express, SocketIO app).

Although they do not communicate now, when both servers are run simultaneously, you can connect the two to create a functional application.

Styles were not applied to these pages. Messaging only accomodates 2 users at a time.
